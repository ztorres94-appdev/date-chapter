# Ruby Practice

Run your Ruby file by typing `ruby ` and then the name of the file you want to run in the Terminal.

If we want to run `date_math.rb`, we can write the command:

```bash
ruby date_math.rb
```

To re-run this command, you can use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to look at the history of commands you've run in a Terminal.

## Date

### date_formatted.rb

Should format and identify different parts of todays date.

```bash
"The year is: 2020, the calendar day is: 1, and the month is: 7."
```


### date_math.rb
Should output the number of days since Ruby was made.

Ruby released to the public on `December 21, 1995`.

```bash
"Ruby is 108937 days old!"
```

### date_monday.rb

Should output:
```bash
Is today Monday? true
```
if today is Monday, or
```bash
Is today Monday? false
```
if today is _not_ Monday.

## Specs
<details>
  <summary>Click here to see names of each test</summary>

date_math.rb should output '8959' when today is Jul 1, 2020 

date_math.rb is not 'hard-coded' to the current date' 

date_formatted.rb outputs 'The year is: 2020, the calendar day is: 1, and the month is: 7.' when today is July 1, 2020 

date_formatted.rb outputs the formatted dates for any past/future date 

date_formatted.rb should output 'Is today Monday? false', when today is not Monday 

date_monday.rb should output 'Is today Monday? false', when today is not Monday 

date_monday.rb should output 'Is today Monday? false', when today is not Monday
